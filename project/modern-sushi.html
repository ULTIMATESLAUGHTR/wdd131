        <p>This page will go over modern-day variations of sushi that we know today. Beginning with the introduction of sushi to the United States in the late 19th century, and its evolution into the diverse styles we have today.</p>
        <section class="overview">
            <h2 class="overview-h2-header">Sushi Leaves Japan</h2>
            <p>Beginning shortly before WWII in the year 1904, sushi began to make its way to the United States. Specifically in Los Angeles, California. With the first mention of sushi coming from an article in the "Los Angeles Herald" that year. Fresh immigrants and the very small Japanese population in California began to open Japanese food restaurants, and at first were hesitant to add sushi to their menus as they were unsure if Americans would accept the concept of raw fish eating.</p>
            <p>Due to anti-Japanese sentiment when WWII started, and for a few years after, many of those same restaurants were forced or bullied into closing. Following a few decades after the war concluded, many in California began to crave Japanese food, and one restaurant called "Kawafuku" opened which began to sell seafood behind the first "sushi-bar" concept.</p>
            <p>Created between 1964-1966 by Noritoshi Kanai, an importer of fish, and his chef partner,- Shigeo Saito, the first sushi bar in the U.S. was born.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Following closely in the footsteps of Kawafuku, another restaurant called "Tokyo Kaikan" began to also offer sushi rolls, and in particular their claim is that they are the origin of the "California Roll". Created by their chef, Ichiro Mashita who said he was inspired to invert the rice an put it on the outside. Thus leaving the seaweed sheet on the inside hidden from view. Since a lot of American people still did not like the visual appeal of the nori, he did this to appeal to them.</p>
            <p>Chef Mashita would not be the only one to claim to invert the roll, there was also around that same time a chef from Vancouver, Canada named Hidekazu Tojo who also claimed to invert his rolls and wrap fresh crab (not imitation) with cucumber and avocado on the inside. That concept, regardless of who actually invented it, created a term in Japanese called "Uramaki". This led to a very large demand for sushi as the California Roll expanded very quickly and the concept of putting the rice on the outside became the norm for most Japanese Restaurants to adopt as they wanted to expand their menus.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Following in the Success of "Uramaki"-style rolls, American chefs began to innovate and began doing deep-fried rolls which also became a sensation, specifically the Las Vegas Roll which is now a staple american sushi roll seen nationwide. With more attention given to out-of-the-box concepts than traditional sushi like Nigiri, and Sashimi.</p>
            <p>As a result, sushi began to be seen as a more mainstream and accessible cuisine, leading to the proliferation of sushi restaurants across the United States which started to appear into the late 1980's.</p>
            <p>Today, sushi is a beloved and widely enjoyed cuisine in the United States, with a diverse range of styles and flavors that reflect the creativity and innovation of chefs across the country.</p>
            <p>Despite its evolution, the core elements of sushi remain the same: high-quality fish, vinegar-seasoned rice, and a balance of flavors and textures, which continue to spread internationally by Sushi Chefs.</p>
