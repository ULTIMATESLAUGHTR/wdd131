        <h1 class="journey-h1-header">My Journey as a Sushi Chef</h1>
        <p>I started my pursuit of food when I was 24 and began to study sushi chef videos and tutorials online through sites like youtube.com. This led me to go back to school at Salt Lake Community College in 2019 and take their Culinary Arts Program so that I could be taken more seriously for an apprenticeship after I graduated.</p>
        <p>Life happened, and so did an international pandemic which shut down the school and I was unable to complete my training. Depressed, and feeling like 2 years of my life were wasted I was about to give up, but a small restaurant very near to where I lived opened and I went there to eat and check it out.</p>
        <p>After I noticed they were short-staffed, I asked if they would be interested in an apprentice, and to my surprise they did, and I started work 3 days later.</p>

            <h2 class="overview-h2-header">The First Few Months</h2>
            <p>In my first few months, I was instructed to learn to cut the vegetables and prepare the sushi rice daily. I also watched the chefs closely, learning their techniques and understanding the importance of precision and cleanliness.</p>
            <p>One of my final tests before I was to start cutting fish was to prepare a cucumber-based decoration for a plate. Which I learned how to manipulate using careful knife cuts. I ended up making my Head Chef happy because he could see that I had really worked hard up to that point.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>As I gained more experience, in the next few months I was given the opportunity to start prepping the fish. I learned about the different types of fish used in sushi, and how to properly trim each one and the cut angles for both Nigiri/Sashimi, and roll toppings.</p>

        <h2 class="solo-sushi-chef-h2-header">Becoming a Solo Sushi Chef</h2>
        <p>After gaining experience in my first restaurant, I was offered an opportunity to work as a solo sushi chef within a new Thai-Restaurant opening soon. This was a significant milestone in my career, as it allowed me to showcase my skills and creativity, and the owner was allowing me to create my own menu and manage the sushi bar as I needed.</p>
        <p>During this time, I went to work setting up a menu that combined traditional sushi elements with Thai flavors, and my own Mexican heritage flavors.</p>
        <p>Working as a solo chef also taught me the importance of time management and organization since I had no one else to rely on but myself.</p>
        <p>Below are some of my signature rolls that I came up with and I really enjoyed the plating and form that they took. Since customers were really excited to have Sushi as an offering.</p>

    <p>Today, I am proud to say that I am a head sushi chef at a small family-run restaurant called, "Nikko Sushi". Where I continue, 6 days a week, to make sushi for my customers as it's still my passion. My journey thus far has been filled with challenges and triumphs, and I am still glad I decided to follow my dreams.</p>

    <p>Even though I'm currently in school, I look forward to going to work each day, and I'm eager to teach these skills so they can be passed down before I leave it for my next career.</p>
