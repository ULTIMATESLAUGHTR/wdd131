        <p>This site explores the fascinating journey of sushi from its humble beginnings as survival food, and into the modern-day variations that we know today. A culinary heritage which is now renowned internationally as some of the most luxurious and sought-after dishes.</p>
        <section class="overview">
            <h2 class="overview-h2-header">Sushi's Humble Beginnings</h2>
            <p>Sushi began as a method of preserving fish when food was very scarce using vinegar, salt and rice. The rice was at first thrown away, as the fermentation was done for months at a time which made it unsafe for human consumption. This practice originated in South-Eastern Asia, later in China, and was introduced to Japan in the Muromachi period which was between (1336-1573).</p>
            <!--Insert Image of Narezushi Here-->
            <p>This was the earliest form of sushi which was called "Narezushi" later in this period the Japanese began to experiment with shorter fermentation times and that led to sushi's first change called "Namanare". This was a partial fermentation which meant the rice could be eaten with the rice.</p> 
            <!--Insert Image of Namanare Here-->
            <p>Only until the Edo Period of Japan, which spans the years (1603-1867) did sushi start to evolve from a survival food, into a fast food, then a new term, coined "haya-zushi" came into being. This process gave birth to the sushi we know the most about in the modern era. </p>
            <!--Insert Table of Sushi Types to include Images of each type Here-->
            <p>Due to this change, rice was only seasoned with rice-vinegar and salt which allowed for it to be served "as-is" along with the fish and sold on the street by vendors in tandem with their daily fish catches which led to the popularization of sushi as a convenient and delicious meal option.</p>
